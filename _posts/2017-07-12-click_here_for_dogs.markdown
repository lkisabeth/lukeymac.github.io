Hey guys!  Sorry it has been so long since my last post but the last few weeks have been craaaazy. Work + School + House-hunting is a full time gig!  To be honest, this is going to be a very short blog post because I need to get back to work! 

I've been working on my Rails app, Doggo, for a while now and I'm almost done!  I'm confident enough in the progress that I'm actually going to go ahead and link to the repo: https://github.com/lukeymac/doggo .  So what is "Doggo", you ask?  Well.. it's basically a blatant ripoff of instagram, for starters.  The larger idea though is this is a social media platform for your dogs.  You may be thinking, "Dogs can't use the internet," and to that I say two things: 1) You haven't met my dogs.  2) You know you want to roleplay as your dog deep down and get other dogs to form pack with yours. Right?  Right.

Once it's all finished and deployed to Heroku, you guys will be the first to know and I'll post another blog post about how I got it deployed and stuff!   This project has been a MASSIVE learning experience.  While working on it, I stumbled upon a Rails guide by a guy named Ben Walker.  He has an entire series about building an instagram clone with Ruby on Rails.  It's AMAZING and incredibly detailed.  I would not have been able to put this thing together without it.  I learned how to incorporate very important JS functionality for "Loves" and "Bark-backs" (which is a dog's way of saying 'comment', obviously) and sooo much more.  Check out the series, as well as his other posts, at www.devwalks.com.

I think that's gonna have to do it for this post, ladies and gents.  I look forward to hearing any and all feedback and just continuing to learn with all of you in the community!

Best wishes and happy coding,

Luke
